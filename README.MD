# ðŸš€ Fahmi Akbar

Hello! I'm Fahmi Akbar.  
A creative mind blending two passions: **graphic design** and **information technology**.

For me, design is not just about making things look good.  
It's a visual languageâ€”a way to tell stories, convey messages, and create memorable impressions.  
Meanwhile, in IT, I see every project as a puzzle: how to build solutions that are **efficient, practical, and enjoyable** to use.

- Always eager to learn new things, especially the latest trends in tech and design.  
- Often lose track of time tinkering with ideasâ€”because inspiration doesnâ€™t keep office hours.
